# MLA - Number Recognition
With this project I intend to explore all my capabilities of C programming, linear algebra, calculus and machine learning capabilities.
A simple algorithm to put in pratice all my knowlodge I have on these topics and learn more about them.
For the training section of the MLA, I will be using the classic MNIST DataSet (more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).

 - State: ongoing
 - Blog: a site will be made where I will state all my journey through out this project and I will link it here;
