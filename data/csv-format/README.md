Thanks to pjreddie for these files and the python scripts.
These files are too large for GitHub, mainly the "mnist_train.csv".
If you want to try to create your own model,
make sure you have python3 installed first.
Then, enter the exe directory and execute the bat file
if you are on Windows or the shell if you're on Linux distro.
