Thanks to pjreddie for these files and the python scripts.
These files are too large for GitHub, mainly the "mnist_train.csv".
If you want to try to create your own model,
make sure you have python 3 installed first.
Then, enter the exe directory and execute the bat file
if you are on windows and the shell if you're on linux.
